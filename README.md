## Introduction

Vinyl is an event discovery app that helps users build tailored nightlife experiences.

I wanted to create an application that solves a personal problem. As a foodie, I am blown away by the amazing selection of restaurants in Providence, however, as a lover of music; not so much.

 Food and music are meant to be enjoyed together, and I have built a platform that allows users like me to enjoy more of what they love.

## Planning Process and Approach

Before starting this project I knew two things. (1) I wanted to solve a problem that effected me perstonally and (2) I wanted to use this as an opportunity to dive into the world of react. From this, Viny was born.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:**
  - Built the frontend client with react.js
  - Decided against usering redux due to the simplicity of the project.
  -
- **Ruby on Rails:**
  - Api built with rails, using a psql database.
  - I went with a relational database due to its ability to navigate relational routes
  -
- **Cancancan Gem:**
  - Used the cancancan gem to handle resource authorizations.
  -
- **Ant-Design React Framework:**
  - To enhance the project UX I used the ant design framework. It offered a lot of well designed components and tools.
  -
- **Semantic UI React Framework:**
  - I also used semantic for its aestetics. Ant Design offers better tools, however, semantic ui offers a cleaner design.
- **Axios Promise based HTTP client for the browser**
  - I decided on axios for it's promise based response & error handling.
